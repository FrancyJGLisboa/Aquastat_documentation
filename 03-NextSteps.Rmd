## **Pending activities**

### Validation comment

  - Need more clarifications on what "remind to use a source for each data point" means.

### National dam capacity time-series (using SWS dam data table)

  - easy to implement by creating a R module. 

### Show the latest value and the corresponding year

  - Is this a dissemination tool?

### Automatic generation of PDF

  - Need clarification from the technical unit.
  
  - What does the technical unit want to report? To whom?
  
  - Potential solution after sttling the doubts: a shiny app (overcomes outdated R packages for data reporting in SWS)
  
  
### Aggregations

  - Once the baseline output is validate, the technical unit needs to clarify the regions, special regions the aggregation should be compiled for. 
  - A SWS plugin tailored for aggregating the results by the regions defined by the technical unit can easily be implemented.
