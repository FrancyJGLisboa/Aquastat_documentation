## **Pending activities**

### Validation comment

  - Need more clarifications on what "remind to use a source for each data point" means.

### National dam capacity time-series (using SWS dam data table)

  - easy to implement by creating an R module. 

### Show the latest value and the corresponding year

  - Is this a dissemination tool?

### Automatic generation of PDF

  - Need clarification from the technical unit.
  
  - What does the technical unit want to report? To whom?
  
  - Potential solution after settling the doubts: a shiny app (overcomes outdated R packages for data reporting in SWS)
  
  
### Aggregations

  - Once the baseline output is validated, the technical unit needs to clarify the regions and/or special regions the aggregation should be compiled for. 
  - An SWS plugin, tailored for aggregating the results by the regions defined by the technical unit, can easily be implemented.
