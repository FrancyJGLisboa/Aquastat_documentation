With the faoswsAquastatBaseline and faoswsAquastatValidation, it is possible to go from data collection to dissemination (speaking only about data) with the following workflow: Figure 3.1: AQUASTAT - SWS framework: from input to dissemination. 3.2 Pending activities 3.2.1 Validation comment Need more clarifications on what “remind to use a source for each data point” means. 3.2.2 National dam capacity time-series (using SWS dam data table) easy to implement by creating an R module. 3.2.3 Show the latest value and the corresponding year Is this a dissemination tool? 3.2.4 Automatic generation of PDF Need clarification from the technical unit. What does the technical unit want to report? To whom? Potential solution after settling the doubts: a shiny app (overcomes outdated R packages for data reporting in SWS) 3.2.5 Aggregations Once the baseline output is validated, the technical unit needs to clarify the regions and/or special regions the aggregation should be compiled for.
