These variables are collectivelly known as Long-term average variables. However, it was observed that, for an unidentified reason, some of these variables have wrong values in the old AQUATSAT Working System and these errors persisted after the migration from the old system into SWS aquastat_legacy dataset. Therefore, the faoswsAquastatLegacy module has the task of correcting these wrong values. 1.1.1 Identify LTAs The very first thing the module needs to do is to identify the LTAs in the aquastat_legacy dataset migrated by CIO - SWS. To identify the LTAs, the faoswsAquastatLegacy module uses the SWS aquastat_reference data table. This data table has a binary variable called ‘lta’ which takes value 1 for the LTA variables/indicators and 0 for non-LTAs. The table below describes the LTAs in the SWS aquastat_reference data table. Table 1.1: Long-term average variables in AQUASTAT. element_code element_name 4150 Long-term average annual precipitation in volume 4151 Long-term average annual precipitation in depth 4154 Groundwater produced internally 4155 Surface water produced internally 4156 Overlap between surface water and groundwater 4157 Total internal renewable water resources (IRWR) 4159 Surface water: entering the country (total) 4160 Surface water: inflow not submitted to treaties 4161 Surface water: inflow submitted to treaties 4162 Surface water: inflow secured through treaties 4164 Surface water: accounted inflow 4165 Surface water: total flow of border rivers 4168 Surface water: accounted flow of border rivers 4171 Surface water: leaving the country to other countries (total) 4172 Surface water: outflow to other countries not submitted to treaties 4173 Surface water: outflow to other countries submitted to treaties 4174 Surface water: outflow to other countries secured through treaties 4176 Surface water: total external renewable 4177 Groundwater: entering the country (total) 4178 Groundwater: leaving the country to other countries (total) 4182 Water resources: total external renewable 4185 Total renewable surface water 4187 Total renewable groundwater 4188 Total renewable water resources 4192 Dependency ratio 4193 Exploitable: regular renewable surface water 4194 Exploitable: irregular renewable surface water 4195 Exploitable: regular renewable groundwater 4196 Total exploitable water resources 4452 Groundwater: accounted inflow 4453 Groundwater: accounted outflow to other countries 4509 Exploitable: total renewable surface water 4536 Overlap: between surface water and groundwater 4549 Environmental Flow Requirements 1.1.2 Calculations before An aspect important of the correction of LTAs in the legacy data is that for LTAs that are also indicators, the right values only show up AFTER the calculations. Therefore, the module used the SWS calculation_rule data table to make the right values to come out.

This dataset serves as an input of the faoswsAquastatUpdate. The aquastat_legacy_corr keeps the same dimension names as the legacy dataset: geographicAreaM49, aquastatElement, timePointYears, flagAquastat, flagAquastatVisibility. The change of aquastatElement to measuredElement (SWS compliant) as well as the flag conversion from flagAquast to flagObaservationStatus are tasked to the faoswsAquastatUpdate module. "]
